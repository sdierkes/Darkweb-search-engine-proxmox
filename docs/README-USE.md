## Background

If you open the search engine interface in a normal browser, the links on the results page will **not work**.  
This is because the results are **.onion links** that require access to the Tor network.  

To view these links, you need to use the **Tor Browser**. However, the Tor Browser by default does not allow access to local network addresses (where the search engine is running). Therefore, a few configuration changes are required.

## Step 1: Allow HTTP Requests

By default, the Tor Browser only allows **HTTPS** connections.  
Since the search engine runs in **HTTP mode** (unless you configured HTTPS), you must explicitly allow HTTP requests.  

1. Open:  
   **Settings â†’ Privacy and Security â†’ Manage Exceptions**  

   ![Tor Browser HTTP exceptions](./images/Brower-http.png)

2. Add the IP address of your search engine to the exception list and save:  

   ![Add IP to exception list](./images/Browser-http-2.png)

## Step 2: Disable Proxy for Local Network

By default, the Tor Browser routes **all traffic** through the Tor network.  
To reach your local network (where the search engine is hosted), you need to exclude it.  

1. Enter the following in the address bar:  

    about:config


2. Accept the risk warning.  
3. Search for `no_proxies_on`.  
4. Edit the entry to include your local network range (CIDR mask). Example:  

![Disable proxy for local network](./images/Browser-noproxy.png)

âœ… After applying these changes, you can use the Tor Browser to access the local search engine and follow `.onion` links from the results page.
